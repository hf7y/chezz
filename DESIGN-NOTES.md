# Chezz — design notes / vision

The durable "big picture" doc for this project, mirroring how the
`scheduler` project keeps its own `DESIGN-NOTES.md` at repo root, outside
`.claude/`. The open GitHub issues on `hf7y/chezz` are the short,
frequently-changing "what's in scope right now" queue nightly-batch reads
first; this file is the
longer-lived record of *why*, for a human or an autonomous run trying to
reconstruct the whole shape of the project without re-deriving it from
scratch. Update it when a real direction gets decided, not every night —
it should read as a slower-moving log of decisions, not a duplicate of
the tracker's day-to-day scope.

## What this game is

A daily-seeded roguelike built on chess rules: White starts as a lone
King, climbs floors fighting procedurally (or, in the narrative campaign's
opening floors, scripted) spawned Black material, and carries surviving
pieces forward floor to floor. `netlify/functions/report.js` backs a live
player-feedback tracker (bug + feature reports, fed by an in-game chat
box) as GitHub Issues on this repo, labelled `player-report` — it
replaced the Google Apps Script tracker (`leaderboard/Code.gs`, retired
#83) whose deployment had drifted out of sync with git for weeks (#82);
the server-side daily/all-time leaderboard it used to also back was
dropped (issue #15, "Option C", confirmed by Zach) in favor of a
purely-local "Your best" in the page itself. Live at
https://chezz.hf7y.com/ (Netlify, #83) and https://hf7y.github.io/chezz/
(GitHub Pages, unretired pending #66). Full deployment/CI shape in
[[project-chezz-automation]] (memory) — not repeated here.

## Decided direction (2026-07-20, human-directed)

Four vision questions, asked directly, answered directly — recording the
decision and reasoning so a later autonomous run doesn't have to re-derive
or re-ask:

1. **Auto-march — REFINED 2026-07-20, later same session; this supersedes
   the "King auto-marches on its own after level clear" framing below.**
   The King does **not** start marching automatically on level clear.
   Instead, the interaction model is drag-driven and generalizes to every
   piece, not just the King:
   - **Click-and-drag stepping**: dragging a piece auto-steps it one
     square at a time in the dragged direction, rather than requiring a
     precise drop on the destination square. For the King this is the
     whole mechanic — no separate "auto-march mode" exists, it's just how
     dragging the King already works.
   - **Formation-follow is an emergent consequence, not a separate
     system**: once the King can be stepped this way, surviving pieces
     naturally "rank up" alongside it. For now, formation logic is naive —
     strongest pieces closest to the King — with the explicit long-term
     goal of custom-tuned positioning so the end formation resembles a
     classic chess back-rank arrangement. Don't over-invest in the tuning
     the first time; ship the naive version, leave it improvable.
   - **Generalizes to other pieces (e.g. Knight)**: the same drag-to-step
     interaction should work for any piece — on drag, find the legal move
     closest to the hover/drop spot and step there. Sliding pieces
     (Rook/Bishop/Queen) and the King have a natural "closest point along
     a line" answer; the **Knight's L-shaped, discontinuous move set makes
     "closest legal move to an arbitrary hover point" a real pathing
     problem, not a trivial one** — flagged explicitly as needing special
     treatment, worth solving as a distinct, smaller follow-up rather than
     blocking the King/sliding-piece version on it.
   - Player can still fully override (this was already true in the
     original framing and still holds): the drag itself IS the control,
     there's no separate autonomous system fighting the player for input.
2. **Terrain: build walls + holes together, not staged.** Full system in
   one pass — holes as impassable squares, boss-gated walls that drop
   when that floor's mini-boss is captured. Sequence after auto-march
   (shares the post-combat/floor-progression surface, wants that flow
   stable first) — not explicitly bundled into the same implementation
   pass, just ordered second.
   - **Refined 2026-07-20: wall/hole COUNT as an intentional carry-over
     gate**, tunable per floor's difficulty design, enabling deliberate
     "dramatic showdown" set-pieces. Worked example from the user: a floor
     with King + pawns vs. a lone Knight, where the gate is narrow enough
     that only the King can pass through it — the pawns literally cannot
     follow, so capturing the Knight before advancing becomes mandatory,
     not optional. This means terrain isn't purely an obstacle/flavor
     layer — floor design should treat gate width as a lever alongside
     material composition when tuning a floor's difficulty curve.
3. **Material sufficiency: strengthen the tuning proxy.** Pure
   engineering (deeper search, real king-safety/tactical eval instead of
   material-only), no playtesting asked of the user. This can run as
   backup/parallel work — doesn't block or get blocked by auto-march/
   terrain.
4. **King→Queen: worth exploring as its own project**, explicitly not
   bundled with the archbishop/bishop-pair numeric tweaks (those stay
   deferred, untouched — no new data justifies another guess at either).
   Given this changes the core tension of the game (the King's fragility
   *is* the game today), this needs a **design spec written and reviewed
   before any implementation starts** — same irreversibility instinct
   the standing redesign-defer criterion already applies to
   core-rule-touching work, now explicitly greenlit for exploration rather
   than indefinite deferral. Nightly-batch's job here is to draft the
   spec into this file (what changes, what stays, how it interacts with
   the King's exit-row win condition, spawn/threat balance, etc.) and
   surface it as a `question`-labelled issue for a checkpoint — not to start writing
   game code against a redesign this size without one. **That spec was
   drafted 2026-07-24 and is superseded on its central question** (the answer
   is royal progression, not a 1:1 replacement); it was deleted here rather
   than left as a trap. Live status and the answer: hf7y/chezz#32.

## Deep feature ideas (recorded 2026-07-20, NOT scoped for implementation)

User-originated ideas, deliberately captured here rather than left to
verbal memory, but explicitly not queued for nightly-batch yet — each
needs its own scoping pass before it's implementation-ready. Treat this
section as a seed list a future vision session picks from, not a to-do
list nightly-batch should start executing against.

- **Neutral evasive flavor piece + knight-upgrade-by-capture chain.** A
  neutral (half-white/half-black) horse-shaped piece that always tries to
  evade capture, appearing as flavor content on the pawn-fodder/terrain
  levels. Capturing it grants the capturing piece a permanent "+knight"
  upgrade — merges knight movement onto whatever piece took it:
  Bishop→Archbishop, Rook→Chancellor, Queen→Amazon. A piece that's already
  knight-combined (i.e. would become knight+knight) becomes a
  **Knightrider** instead — a fairy piece that repeats knight-move steps
  in a straight line — with a proposed graphic treatment of an
  upside-down knight glyph to visually distinguish it. Needs: capture
  logic for a non-aligned/neutral third side, an evasion AI for the
  neutral piece, upgrade-application logic per piece type, and a
  Knightrider move-generator (doesn't exist in the current fairy-piece
  set — Archbishop/Chancellor/Amazon are simple move-set unions, a
  knightrider's repeated-knight-step movement is a different shape of
  rule entirely).
- **Graphics pipeline — SIGN-OFF GRANTED 2026-07-27, track 1 built.** Zach
  answered the standing new-external-dependency gate in scheduler
  the then-current file channel: *"Yes, pursue the gemini path, safe bounded
  account balance exists for testing precisely this. Lift creds from
  vkv-inventory if possible pending the creation of chezz specific ones."*
  Track 1 is now implemented (see below for what was built and the one
  thing still missing); track 2 (the fairy-piece font) is untouched and
  still has no gate on it.

  **What shipped 2026-07-27 (nightly):**
  - `tools/generate-pieces.mjs` — prompts `gemini-2.5-flash-image` for all
    18 pieces (9 types × 2 sides) over plain `fetch`, no SDK.
  - `tools/sprite-postprocess.js` — chroma-keys the magenta field out,
    crops to content, fits-and-centers into 32×32, and snaps every pixel to
    the game's own monochrome ramp. Runs on a Playwright canvas.
  - `tools/wire-pieces.mjs` — bakes `assets/pieces/*.png` into
    `index1.html`'s `PIECE_SPRITES` as base64 data URIs.
  - `index1.html` — `pieceGlyphHtml` renders a sprite when one exists and
    the Unicode glyph when one doesn't, **per piece**.

  **Three decisions worth not re-litigating:**
  - *Zero new dependencies.* vkv-inventory's version needs Python +
    `google-genai` + Pillow + numpy. Chezz is a Node repo with no Python,
    and Playwright (already a devDependency, since `npm test` is Playwright)
    ships a browser whose `<canvas>` does every pixel operation Pillow was
    doing. So the port is a rewrite, not a copy — same pipeline shape, none
    of the install footprint.
  - *Monochrome is enforced by the pipeline, not by the prompt.* The palette
    snap means a sprite CANNOT come back off-palette even if the model
    ignores the instruction. The monochrome constraint is a standing human
    decision; leaving it to prompt compliance would have made it a
    coin-flip.
  - *Sprites are baked in, and `PIECE_SPRITES` ships empty.* Data URIs keep
    chezz a single self-contained HTML file (what makes the share links, the
    `file://` test harness and the Pages deploy work with no build step).
    Empty-by-default means the committed game is byte-for-byte the glyph
    game it was, and generation is a deliberate manual step — never a side
    effect of `npm run check` or a nightly run, since each run costs money
    and returns different art.

  **Still missing: the API key.** No `GEMINI_API_KEY` is reachable from an
  unattended run, so no sprite has actually been generated yet. "Lift creds
  from vkv-inventory" turned out not to be possible: vkv stores no key
  anywhere — its `tools/generate_sprite.py` documents `export
  GEMINI_API_KEY=...` as something a human types into an interactive shell,
  and there is no key in its repo, its scheduler conf, or the environment.
  Everything downstream of the API call is tested and green (11 tests across
  `test/sprite-postprocess.spec.mjs` and `test/piece-sprites.spec.mjs`); the
  generator exits non-zero with instructions when the key is absent. One
  `export` away from producing art.

  The original two-track note, still accurate on track 2:
  1. **Autonomous AI-generated sprites**, extracting and adapting the
     pixel-art Gemini API workflow already built in the `vkv-inventory`
     project, made autonomous for chezz. **This is a NEW external service
     dependency** (an image-generation API call) — the standing gate
     already reserves this for explicit user sign-off, no autopilot
     exception (this is the same gate the tracker's existing
     `2026-07-17T07:25:16.315Z` sprite-replacement report is deferred
     behind). Cross-project too: would need coordinating with whatever
     `vkv-inventory`'s workflow actually looks like today, not something
     to build blind from a one-line description.
  2. **A custom font file with real typography for the fairy pieces**
     (Archbishop/Chancellor/Amazon/Knightrider etc., which today lean on
     Unicode knight-combo glyphs). No new external service dependency in
     the same sense — an asset-creation project, not an API integration.
     Explicitly associated with "Chezz Classic" below, not the current
     arcade-cabinet-reskinned build.

## "Chezz Classic" — all three questions resolved; work is #89

Raised 2026-07-20: the user wants an older version of chezz — at the time,
live at `hf7y.com/chezz.html`, which redirected to an OCF Berkeley-hosted
copy (note: **not** `hf7y.github.io/chezz/`, the current live site this
repo's automation deploys) — developed as **"its own production
stream."** The user confirmed directly: the code lived on `main`, and
narrative-campaign work eventually overwrote it there (file content, not
git history — the commits themselves were never destroyed).

**Resolved by git archaeology, not guesswork**: `readable-html` (an
already-existing branch, still pushed to `origin`) is the **exact
merge-base** between itself and current `main` — `git merge-base
readable-html main` returns `readable-html`'s own tip (`6815336`,
2026-07-16, "Merge simplify-and-polish: dedup pass, mobile touch-drag
fix, promotion dialog fix"), and `git log --oneline readable-html..main`
starts with `c13e228 Add a scripted narrative campaign` as the very first
commit past it. That's a clean, unambiguous boundary — no divergent
history to reconcile, no guessing between candidate branches. **Action
taken**: created and pushed a clearly-named `chezz-classic` branch
pointing at that same commit (`git branch chezz-classic readable-html`),
so it's a discoverable, purpose-named reference going forward instead of
an ambiguous old branch name — `readable-html` itself was left alone
(unchanged), `chezz-classic` is a second ref to the same commit.

**Questions 2 and 3 answered by Zach, 2026-09-04 (realisateur `/ideate`),
in hf7y/chezz#66:**

2. `hf7y.com`'s topology has since changed: Zach repointed it away from
   the OCF-Berkeley redirect, and it is now his GitHub Pages root
   (confirmed 2026-09-04: `dig +short hf7y.com` resolves to GitHub
   Pages' IPs, `hf7y/hf7y.github.io`'s Pages API reports `status:
   "built"`, `cname: "hf7y.com"`, and `https://hf7y.com/chezz/` answers
   200 — re-verified independently 2026-09-05, still 200). Publishing
   there unattended is a solved problem now; the earlier "sandbox cannot
   reach `hf7y.com`" note above was a stale artifact of the old topology,
   not a standing restriction.
3. Classic runs in the **same** stream as chezz narrative, not a second
   registered scheduler project — one repo, one backlog, one intake.
   That depends on the in-game report intake existing (#83) and on
   classic and narrative sharing one engine (#89, see below).

Both questions are closed out on #66 as of this write-up.

## Size policy — decided 2026-07-25 (human reply in that day's report)

The index1.html byte limit is **abandoned for chezz narrative** (the
build on `main`, hosted publicly). The 2026-07-24 "only ~2.5KB of
headroom, urgent" framing is retired: `scripts/check-size.mjs` now
prints the size on every run (creep stays visible) but never fails the
narrative build, and size must never again be the reason a feature is
pre-deferred — do the work, run the checks after, and if a real limit is
ever exceeded, be noisy about it (file an issue for Zach with
`scheduler ask chezz "..."` to raise the threshold before continuing)
rather than quietly deferring or trimming.

The limit stays **enforced only on the `chezz-classic` branch**. Classic
is the elegance/efficiency track: future dev passes there work to make
the project *simpler*, with a stated long-term aspiration of fitting on
a Game Boy classic cartridge. Caps on classic remain 50,000 soft /
100,000 hard for now (measured 70,822 bytes on 2026-09-04, 142% of the
soft target — not "well under" as stated here before; see #90).

This supersedes: the 2026-07-14 "stop and revisit rather than cut
comments" call (narrative side — moot now that nothing needs cutting),
and closes the 2026-07-24 size question (answered 2026-07-25).

## Stability milestone

**Current:** the autopilot loop is stable — players file ideas in-game,
unattended nightly runs ship or triage them, and anything needing Zach
reaches him as a `question`-labelled GitHub issue on `hf7y/chezz` instead
of stalling silently. Judge every new idea against this bar: required to
hold it → `active`; past it → `(parked)` (or `(waiting: <dep>)`) with one
line of why.

## Standing design rules (migrated off the retired file channel, 2026-08-15)

Resolved human design calls that were living only in the coordination
files deleted in realisateur#293 (their history is in git). They are decisions, not backlog:

- **Death / respawn (superseded 2026-08-22, issue #4):** a White-side
  (player) zero-legal-moves deadlock is this game's only "death" signal.
  It now sends the run back to floor 1 as a fresh lone King (`checkDeath()`/
  `respawnFromFloorOne()`) rather than resetting just the current floor —
  the 2026-07-19 "never restarts from floor 1" rule this overturns is
  retired. The captured bank and the spawn-budget ratchet both survive the
  death untouched, so a respawned floor 1 is proportionally as tough as the
  run had already earned; a `diedOnce` run also permanently skips the
  scripted `NARRATIVE_STAGES` campaign (a fixed intro, not something to
  replay every death) and gets a captured-bank-sized terrain gate
  (`placeDeathGate()`) instead. Built from Zach's sketch, not a full spec —
  expect this to be retuned from playtesting feedback.
- **Scripted bosses:** a `NARRATIVE_STAGES` boss must never be capturable on
  move 1; `placeScriptedStage` is capture-aware against the carried army.
- **Colour scheme is monochrome** — an explicit, repeated human ask. Do not
  reintroduce a saturated or hued palette without a fresh one.
- **Move-into-check:** hanging the KING ONLY is illegal (a move leaving the
  King capturable next turn is rejected). Other pieces stay hangable —
  unchanged risk/reward. Done 2026-07-24 (`2783c357`), `isLegalMove`.
- **Audio + vibration (answered 2026-08-22, issue #5):** default ON for
  capture/check/floor-clear, short pre-rendered wooden-click WAV samples
  (`tools/generate-earcons.mjs`, baked in by `tools/wire-earcons.mjs`) rather
  than live WebAudio FM synthesis — one shared mute toggle (`#audioToggle`,
  `localStorage.chezzAudioEnabled`) covers both channels. Live FM synthesis
  was asked to be researched separately in a branch with findings reported as
  a draft PR, not built on `main`.

## Difficulty theory: analytic material sufficiency (answered 2026-08-16, issue #6)

`research/balance/` (the scholarship lane, [[project-chezz-research]] if
that memory exists) is confirmed as the right home for the open "what
White material is actually needed to beat a given Black composition"
question — no separate theory/math branch. The method is constrained,
too: **analytic proofs, not playtesting or statistics.** AGENT
playtesting (an unattended run burning turns self-playing floors to
gather empirical data) is explicitly NOT in scope for this question, even
though it's a tool nightly runs otherwise have available — this is
theoretical work, not experimental. Full framing in
`research/balance/README.md`'s "Open, not yet studied" section.

Zach's answer also asked that an issue be filed with a project called
"bibliothecaire" to request research help. That repo isn't reachable from
this run's environment — no `hf7y/bibliothecaire` (or similarly-named)
repo exists under the `hf7y` GitHub account, and neither the `scheduler`
nor `discipline` CLIs are on PATH here to resolve an internal project
alias to a real remote (see the infra-gaps note this same run filed,
issue #9's pattern repeating in a plain runner environment this time, not
just on `monkey`). Filed as a `question` issue on `hf7y/chezz` instead of
guessing at a URL.
